# Replication-ABM-Paper-Uninformed-Individuals-Promote-Democratic-Consensus-in-Animal-Groups

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for one of my master's third semester projects for the course "Computational Modelling of Social Systems". In this course our task was to select a publication that adresses an agent-based model (ABM) and and write a review report about it. If possible we should try to replicate the publication or parts of it, yet that was not mandatory as many ABMs are too complicated to implement them within the course's time or require restricted data sets.

## Technologies and Tools
- Simulation
- Agent-based Modelling

## Repository Contents
- `script`: Python program script that implements the ABM of that contains the the whole project's code including the data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.
- `report`: PDF of final report.

- **Note:** 

## Installation
