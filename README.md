# Replication-ABM-Paper-Uninformed-Individuals-Promote-Democratic-Consensus-in-Animal-Groups

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for one of my master's third semester projects for the course "Computational Modelling of Social Systems". In this course our task was to select a publication is based on an agent-based model (ABM) and write a review report about it. If feasible we should also try to replicate the publication or parts of it, yet that was not mandatory as many ABMs are too complicated to implement them within the course's time. I choose to review the publication:

- Couzin, I. D., Ioannou, C. C., Demirel, G., Gross, T., Torney, C. J., Hartnett, A., ... & Leonard, N. E. (2011). Uninformed individuals promote democratic consensus in animal groups. science, 334(6062), 1578-1580.

The publications centers around spatial model for collective-decision making processes. Due the course of my review report I tried to replicate Counzin et al's (2011) finding that “self-interested and strongly opinionated minorities can exert their influence on group movement decisions” and so their publication's Figure 1. The code of this repository gives this replication attempt.

## Objectives
- Replicate partly the results of Counzin et al's (2011) agent-based model for collective-decision making processes

## Key Findings
- The results could not be exactly replicated and only show a similiar general trend. This stems likely from the fact that
1. Precise parameter information necessary for exact replication was not given
2. The lack of computational power

## Technologies and Tools
- Simulation
- Agent-based Modelling

## Repository Contents
- `script`: Python program script that implements the ABM of that contains the the whole project's code including the data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.
- `report`: PDF of final report.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed. Clone this repository and install the required packages using:

git clone [repository-link]
cd [repository-name]
